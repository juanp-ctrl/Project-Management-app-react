# Project management app - in React

A mini-project part of the 'React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. React Router & Redux)' course by <a href='https://github.com/maxschwarzmueller'>@maxschwarzmueller.</a>

In this exercise, the goal was to build a Project Management Web App using all the essentials of React, the build, style, and configuration of reusable components, the management of states, accessing DOM elements and browser APIs using Refs, and the management of JSX rendering positions with portal.
